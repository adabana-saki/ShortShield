## Code Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode (already configured)
- Avoid `any` type — use proper types
- Export types that are used across files

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use the existing UI component patterns

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Keep styles scoped to components

### File Structure

```
src/
├── background/      # Service worker logic
├── content/         # Content scripts (DOM manipulation)
├── popup/           # Popup UI components
├── options/         # Options page components
└── shared/          # Shared utilities, types, hooks
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Test files go in `tests/` with `.test.ts` extension

---

## Commit Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This helps us:

- Generate changelogs automatically
- Trigger semantic versioning
- Keep history readable

### Format

```

[optional body]
